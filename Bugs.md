Bugs:
+XP orbs at location on long loop, low priority (also hard)
+Helmets despawn on zombies after some time (mc feature)
+Sometimes NPCs (villages) won't respawn after executing /killall
++Temp fixed, now there is spam to the console when using the command -.-
+Skript gives random errors after a while
+If you get killed when drinking a health potion you don't respawn (critical during lazarus' battle)
+Zombie AI ignores player when it runs away
+Zombie spawns too many
+Zombie teleporting is very visible
+Zombie spawn with armour

Cannot reproduce bugs:

+After levelling up the XP bar is full (can not reproduce) 
+zombies falling trough floor (minecraft bug?) (less frequent as of 19.05.15) (never happened again since)

Fixed: 

+Takes too long to kill a basic zombie (my hand hurts now :/)
+ button on the first quest house only works once
+Zombies fly way too far if you spam hit them
+Zombie spawn without ID and Level
++Cases:
++A zombie spawned with none level and ID, the max health was 37.5 and it is spawning health was 16 (picture taken 2015-06-16_00.42.46.png) 
+Zombie spawn with wrong armour
++Cases:
+++full gold (with some enchantment) on a lvl 2 air air zombie (as of 11.05.15 ID 18)
+++Full Leather (with some enchantment) on a lvl 2 air air zombie (as of 19.05.15 ID 19)
+No regeneration what-so-ever (added potions, and slow regeneration)
+After removing a fixed spawn it  when using the "/seespawns true" will still show upcommand (fixed)
+No alias for the PXP command (fixed)
+Double zombie spawn (walking away, then coming back) (fixed)
+Zombies randomly looses interest for you during a battle (functioning as normal)
+Zombies spawn with a random number of max health. appears to be random.
+Re-spawning at the wrong location (second quest) (fixed)
+Death can trigger a warning about unexpecting shifting of level (fixed)

Added features:
+No penalty for dying (You now loose 5% of your xp, but not levelling down)
