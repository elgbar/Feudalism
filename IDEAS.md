Alpha Map
===

The player will not have the the amount of freedom as in the full version. 

A few things need to be done on the coding side before the alpha map will be released. This include:

+Mob spawning (and despawning)
+Levelling
+quest basics

On another note we also need some in-game items set-ups:

+items (like armour, sword and bow(?))
+map
+quests


The quests

+Three quests in total.
1. basics created for the player to get to know the way thing works (also for quest developing)
2. More demanding quest (lvl requirement). player goes trough a dungeon and ends up fighting a boss
3. The final quest, even harder. player need to kill an amount of zombies in a quarantined small town.

After the quest the player can choose to reset his/hers in-game account and restart.
