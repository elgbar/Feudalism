Feudalism
=========

This is the source code of an ingame minecraft RPG called Feudalism. 

What we aim to do make here is a minecraft server ran entierly by skript (http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/skript/) and a few addons.

To run Feudalism you need some addons to skript:

+skript 2.1.1

++RandomSK Beta 2.0

++skQuery 3.22.1

++WildSkript 1.8

++skRayFall 1.5

++ExtrasSK 1.1

You can find all all addons and skript itself at http://www.skunity.com/
