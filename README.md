Feudalism
=========

This is the source of the Feudalism minigame/server

What we aim to do make here is a minecraft server ran entierly by skript (http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/skript/) and a skript addon called skriptPlus (http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/skript/forum/misc/59406-latest-skript-plus-pr2-0-destroyer4017s-addons/)

But to start we are using Citizen 2 (http://ci.citizensnpcs.co/job/Citizens2/) and an add-on called Sentry (http://ci.citizensnpcs.co/job/Sentry/)
