Feudalism
=========

This is the source of the Feudalism minigame/server

What we aim to do make here is a minecraft server ran entierly by skript (http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/skript/) and a skript addon called skriptPlus (http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/skript/forum/misc/59406-latest-skript-plus-pr2-0-destroyer4017s-addons/)

If you like to read about our project, and what we're gonna do please read the IDEAS.md file

Note: the idea has been changed so the ideas and plans in idea.md is no longer what we plan :/

To run Feudalism you need some addons to skript:
++RandomSK
++skQuery
++WildSkript
++skRayFall

You can find them all at http://www.skunity.com/
